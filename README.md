This repository contains jupyter notebook codes for 3 machine learning problems.
The first problem is about implementing different optimisation algorithms. We use the famous boston house price list data for this.
The second problem is similar to a word2vec problem where we take a text data set and process it to a vectorized form so that it can be used in required algorithms. The dataset we use here is from Amazon food reviews.
The third problem uses the same dataset from Amazon food reviews and try to predict the score of the reviews being either negative or positive.
